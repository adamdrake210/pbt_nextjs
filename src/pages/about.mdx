# Something

was recently in the job hunt before starting my
[new position at Hy-Vee](/blog/joining-hy-vee). During that experience, I
learned a lot about what benefits I like and dislike. Through some
self-reflection, I've put together a list of benefits I care about. I think this
goes without saying, but these are simply my opinions - your mileage may vary.

## Positives

1. **Talented co-workers.** Above everything else, I want to be surrounded by
   smart people who will push me to learn, grow exponentially, and progress in
   my career.
2. **Flexible hours and remote work.** After a three-month stint
   [working remotely abroad](/blog/the-search-for-everything), there's no way I
   could go back to a typical 9-5 desk job. Ideally, I'll work from home at
   least one day a week. I think 100% remote work is excellent, but not for
   everyone.
3. **Personal health.** Having a culture with a healthy work-life balance that
   doesn't promote burnout is critical. A culture focused around personal health
   that has adequate health coverage as well as some sort of gym package
   (on-site or stipend).
4. **Autonomy.** Does your manager give you the freedom to make decisions in
   your area of expertise? Do they trust and value your opinion? Do they go to
   battle for you? Do they set clear expectations?
