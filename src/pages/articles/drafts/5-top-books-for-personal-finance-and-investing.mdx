  '5 great books to help with your personal finance and investing situation.
  From wealth experts such as Tony Robbins, Ramit Sethi and Robert T Kiyosaki.'
intro:
  'Personal Finance is not something we are taught about in schools, in fact in
  many peoples’ lives it is not taught at all. However, it is a vital component
  of living a happy life. If you don’t have your finances in order then it can
  lead to all kinds of problems - debt, stress, lack of security to name a few.
  Whereas if you do have your finances in order it can lead to wealth and riches
  in your life, choices and the opportunity for great experiences.'
