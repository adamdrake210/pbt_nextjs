### What is it about?

“The greatest true-crime story in music history, as only James Patterson can tell it. Enriched by exclusive interviews with Lennon’s friends and associates, including Paul McCartney, The Last Days of John Lennon is the thrilling true story of two men who changed history: One whose indelible songs enliven our world to this day—and the other who ended the beautiful music with five pulls of a trigger.”

### Why I want to read it

I have loved The Beatles ever since I first discovered my parents’ White Album record as a nine-year-old. I remember being spellbound by songs such as Back In The USSR,  Bungalow Bill and While My Guitar Gently Weeps and then feeling a sense of genuine loss when my parents explained to me that the band couldn’t make any more music because one of its members had been murdered a few years before. 

I’ve read, watched and listened to much more about The Beatles since then and find myself increasingly captivated by the music and the stories behind it. I know of James Patterson as a best-selling fiction writer (although I’ve not read anything by him yet) and I’m really interested to read how he applies his writing style to real-life events that are arguably far more powerful than a made up story.

  <h2>2. Data Action: Using Data For Public Good - Sarah Williams</h2>

### What is it about?

“Big data can be used for good--from tracking disease to exposing human rights violations--and for bad--implementing surveillance and control. Data inevitably represents the ideologies of those who control its use; data analytics and algorithms too often exclude women, the poor, and ethnic groups. 

In Data Action, Sarah Williams provides a guide for working with data in more ethical and responsible ways. Too often data has been used--and manipulated--to make policy decisions without much stakeholder input. Williams outlines a method that emphasizes collaboration among data scientists, policy experts, data designers, and the public. This approach creates trust and co-ownership in the data by opening the process to those who know the issues best.”

### Why I want to read it

I work with data in my day job, so I have spent a lot of time thinking (and reading) about its huge potential for making the world a better place as well as the dangers of too much personal data accumulating in the hands of companies and states. I’m really interested to see what Sarah Williams proposes in Data Action. There is definitely a need for an ethical framework for working with data as its impact on every aspect of life increases. - James

    3. Badass Habits - Jen Sincero
  </h2>

  altText="First Principles: What America's Founders Learned from the Greeks and Romans and How That Shaped Our Country"
  imageCategory="book-summaries"
/>

### What is it about?

“Badass Habits is a eureka-sparking, easy-to-digest look at how our habits make us who we are, from the measly moments that happen in private to the resolutions we loudly broadcast (and, erm, often don't keep) on social media. Habit busting and building goes way beyond becoming a dedicated flosser or never showing up late again--our habits reveal our unmet desires, the gaps in our boundaries, our level of self-awareness, and our unconscious beliefs and fears. Badass Habits features Jen's trademark hilarious voice and offers a much-needed fresh take on the conventional wisdom and science that shape the optimism (or pessimism?) around the age-old topic of habits. The book includes enlightening interviews with people who've successfully strengthened their discipline backbones, new perspective on how to train our brains to become our best selves, and offers a simple, 21 day, step-by-step guide for ditching habits that don't serve us and developing the habits we deem most important. Habits shouldn't be impossible to reset--and with healthy boundaries, knowledge of--and permission to go after--our desires, and an easy to implement plan of action, we can make any new goal a joyful habit.”

### Why I want to read it

I’m not expecting this to be an easy read but I love the concept and I have
always wanted to learn more about classic philosophical ideas and understand how
the world we live in today is built upon them. I think the biographical aspect
of this book will help to put these ideas in a practical context and I’m
interested to read some of Thomas E. Ricks work for the first time. - James

  <h2>4. Volume Control: Hearing in a Deafening World - David Owen</h2>
</Box>

<Image266x400
  src="david-owen-volume-control_eskumj"
  altText="Volume Control: Hearing in a Deafening World"
  imageCategory="book-summaries"
/>

### What is it about?

"Our sense of hearing makes it easy to connect with the world and the people
around us. The human system for processing sound is a biological marvel, an
intricate assembly of delicate membranes, bones, receptor cells, and neurons.
Yet many people take their ears for granted, abusing them with loud restaurants,
rock concerts, and Q-tips. And then, eventually, most of us start to go deaf.

Millions of Americans suffer from hearing loss. Faced with the cost and stigma
of hearing aids, the natural human tendency is to do nothing and hope for the
best, usually while pretending that nothing is wrong. In Volume Control, David
Owen argues this inaction comes with a huge social cost. He demystifies the
science of hearing while encouraging readers to get the treatment they need for
hearing loss and protect the hearing they still have.

Hearing aids are rapidly improving and becoming more versatile. Inexpensive
high-tech substitutes are increasingly available, making it possible for more of
us to boost our weakening ears without bankrupting ourselves. Relatively soon,
physicians may be able to reverse losses that have always been considered
irreversible. Even the insistent buzz of tinnitus may soon yield to relatively
simple treatments and techniques. With wit and clarity, Owen explores the
incredible possibilities of technologically assisted hearing. And he proves that
ears, whether they're working or not, are endlessly interesting."

### Why I want to read it

I am an avid music fan my whole life and have always loved listening to music. I
often wonder at the amazing variety in sound that the human ear is able to pick
up. To recognise voices, to distinguish notes, to pick out different sounds… yet
it is something I think so many of us take for granted and only when something
goes wrong do we suddenly appreciate what it is to hear. This book seems to fit
exactly and how many people accept loss of hearing as part of life. Two of my
sons also suffer from some hearing loss and they do wear hearing aids. This is
also a motivation to read this book to understand more about what they are going
through and what potential solutions may be available in the future. - Adam

  <h2>5. How I Learned to Understand the World - Hans Rosling</h2>

  altText="How I Learned to Understand the World"
  imageCategory="book-summaries"

### What is it about?

"It was facts that helped him explain how the world works. But it was curiosity
and commitment that made the late Hans Rosling, author of worldwide bestseller
[Factfulness](https://paperbacktravels.com/book-summaries/economics/hans-rosling-factfulness),
the most popular researcher of our time.

How I Learned to Understand the World is Hans Rosling's own story of how a young
scientist became a revolutionary thinker, and takes us from the swelter of an
emergency clinic in Mozambique, to the World Economic Forum at Davos.

In collaboration with Swedish journalist Fanny Härgestam, Hans Rosling wrote his
memoir with the same joy of storytelling that made a whole world listen when he
spoke."

_Taken from the product description on Amazon._

### Why I want to read it

Hans Rosling dealt in facts and in this day and age sometimes facts are in short
supply when they could be really needed. By looking at facts he was able to
bring a clear point of view on many topics. He also spent much of his life in
poorer parts of the world helping stem disease outbreaks using his research. I
don’t know too much about his story though which is exactly why I want to read
this book. Talented people who use their skills for good always fascinate me. -
