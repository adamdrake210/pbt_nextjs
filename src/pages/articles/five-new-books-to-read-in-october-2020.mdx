## 1. Trust: America's Best Chance

### Author
Pete Buttigieg

### What is it about?
“Interweaving history, political philosophy, and affecting passages of memoir, Buttigieg explores the strong relationship between measures of prosperity and levels of social trust. He provides an impassioned account of a threefold crisis of trust: in our institutions, in each other, and in the American project itself. Today, these perilous patterns of distrust have wreaked havoc on nearly every sector of society, as Americans increasingly resent the very government that needs to be part of the solution. With the internet and partisan television networks acting as accelerants, Americans jettison any sense of shared reality, lose confidence in experts and scientists, and cope with the grim national tragedy of a pandemic that has only further exemplified the lethality of distrust.
Buttigieg contends that our success, or failure, at confronting the greatest challenges of the decade―racial and economic justice, pandemic resilience, and climate action―will rest on whether we can effectively cultivate, deepen, and, where necessary, repair the networks of trust that are now endangered, or for so many, have never even existed.”

### Why I want to read it
I have been following the 2020 American presidential election race since the primaries. Former candidate Pete Buttigieg was not somebody I had previously heard of but I was intrigued by his story: a thirty-something, openly gay war veteran with political experience as mayor of South Bend, Indiana. 

The more I heard him speak, the more impressed I became with his ideas and competence, so I am looking forward to getting a deeper insight into his life and his ambitions to be part of a positive change in his country’s society. Still only 38, I expect we’re going to be hearing about Buttigieg for decades to come.

## 2. How to Decide: Simple Tools for Making Better Choices

### Author
Annie Duke

### What is it about?
“What if there was a better way to make quality decisions so you can think clearly, feel more confident, second-guess yourself less, and ultimately be more decisive and be more productive?

Making good decisions doesn't have to be a series of endless guesswork. Rather, it's a teachable skill that anyone can sharpen. In How to Decide, bestselling author Annie Duke and former professional poker player lays out a series of tools anyone can use to make better decisions. You'll learn:
  •  To identify and dismantle hidden biases.
  •  To extract the highest quality feedback from those whose advice you seek.
  •  To more accurately identify the influence of luck in the outcome of your decisions.
  •  When to decide fast, when to decide slow, and when to decide in advance.
  •  To make decisions that more effectively help you to realize your goals and live your values.

Through interactive exercises and engaging thought experiments, this book helps you analyze key decisions you've made in the past and troubleshoot those you're making in the future. Whether you're picking investments, evaluating a job offer, or trying to figure out your romantic life, How to Decide is the key to happier outcomes and fewer regrets.”

### Why I want to read it
The impact of decision-making has become progressively clearer to me with age. Decisions I made very quickly or on gut instinct when I was younger have had life-changing long-term consequences. Moving abroad after university, taking and leaving specific jobs, spending time learning specific skills rather than others. 

So the idea of taking a more structured approach to decision-making appeals to me (better late than never!). That’s not to say that gut instinct is always right or wrong, but I look forward to reading How to Decide to arm myself with a better set of tools for approaching important decisions in the future. - James

## 3. A Life on Our Planet: My Witness Statement and a Vision for the Future

### Author
Sir David Attenborough

### What is it about?
“I am 94. I've had an extraordinary life. It's only now that I appreciate how extraordinary.

As a young man, I felt I was out there in the wild, experiencing the untouched natural world - but it was an illusion. The tragedy of our time has been happening all around us, barely noticeable from day to day - the loss of our planet's wild places, its biodiversity.

I have been witness to this decline. A Life on Our Planet is my witness statement, and my vision for the future. It is the story of how we came to make this, our greatest mistake - and how, if we act now, we can yet put it right.

We have one final chance to create the perfect home for ourselves and restore the wonderful world we inherited.'

All we need is the will to do so.”

### Why I want to read it
Sir David Attenborough is beloved in Britain. His voice is known to millions who have grown up to his narrations on television shows exploring exotic and faraway parts of the world most of us could only dream about visiting. Now 93, Attenborough really has lived an extraordinary life and I’m really looking forward to learning more about it in his own words.  - James
