## Summary of main ideas

Factfulness identifies ten ‘instincts’ that most humans have about the world
which distort our understanding of reality:

**The Gap Instinct:** People typically divide the world into two groups: The
“developed” world and the “developing” world. Factfulness argues that there are
really four levels of income. People in Level 1 survive on
$ a day. This goes up to $4 a day for Level 2 and Level 3 is
$16 a day. Level 4 starts at $64 a day. Viewed through this lens, the progress
of entire populations moving upwards from the very poorest levels is striking.

**The Negativity Instinct:** Information about bad events is much more likely to
reach us and so we should expect bad news. Gradual progress is also happening
but that is not news.

**The Straight Line Instinct:** We assume that things will continue to happen in
straight lines. In reality, lines curve. An exaggerated example, the line
representing a child’s growth curves and goes flat as they approach adulthood.

**The Fear Instinct:** How frightened we are about something is not directly
related to how dangerous it is. Frightening things get our attention.

**The Size Instinct:** We often see a large number without the context of other
numbers. Comparing or dividing numbers enables us to put things in proportion.

**The Generalization Instinct:** It is very easy to assume that every member of
a group is the same. In reality our understanding of the world is often
distorted by failure to see that groups are made up of sometimes very different
smaller groups. For example, countries in Asia range from very poor to very
rich, so it makes no sense to simply label Asia as poor.

**The Destiny Instinct:** “The destiny instinct is the idea that innate
characteristics determine the destinies of people, countries, religions, or
cultures.“ In reality, some things just change very slowly. Rosling suggests
talking to your grandparents about their values to see how they differ from
yours.

**The Single Perspective Instinct:** “We find simple ideas very attractive.” In
reality, the world is complex so we need to be prepared to consider opinions and
ideas that don’t snugly fit into a simple worldview.

**The Blame Instinct:** It is common to look for a scapegoat when something goes
wrong. As a result, we often ignore the real cause of a problem and forget that
bad things sometimes just happen without anyone meaning for it to.

**The Urgency Instinct:** Even if something seems urgent, it rarely is. Acting
too quickly reduces our ability to think clearly, leading to unintended
consequences.

## How this book can help you

Read this book if you want to develop a more nuanced understanding of the world
and challenge your existing assumptions (which are probably incorrect!). You
might expect a book devoted to telling its readers they are wrong would come
across as preachy, but Rosling and his co-authors had a gift for conveying ideas
with humility, humour and simple common sense.

Factfulness is also a good starting point for anyone looking to understand the
power of using data to explore ideas and share them in a persuasive way.
