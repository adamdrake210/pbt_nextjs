### Summary of main ideas

In the Ride of a Lifetime, former Walt Disney CEO Robert Iger gives an insight
into a distinguished career that saw him rise from an entry-level job at
American Broadcasting Company (ABC) to becoming the head of one of the world’s
most famous corporations. Iger draws on his wide-ranging experiences to compile
the following ten principles for successful leadership, citing numerous examples
from his career to elaborate on their importance in his success.

**Optimism:** “If you walk up and down the hall constantly telling people ‘The
sky is falling,’ a sense of doom and gloom will, over time, permeate the
company. You can’t communicate pessimism to the people around you. It’s ruinous
to morale.”

**Courage:** “If you want innovation, you need to grant permission to fail.”

**Focus:** “Avoid getting into the business of manufacturing trombone oil. You
may become the greatest trombone oil manufacturer in the world, but in the end
the world only consumes a few quarts of trombone oil a year.” (quoting Iger’s
former boss Dan Berg).

**Decisiveness:** “There is never 100% certainty.”

**Curiosity:** “The path to innovation begins with curiosity.”

**Fairness:** “This doesn’t mean that you lower your expectations... it means
you create an environment where people know you will hear them out... and that
they will be given second chances for honest mistakes.”

**Thoughtfulness:** “Long shots aren’t normally as long as they seem.”

**Authenticity:** “A little respect goes a long way and the absence of it can be
costly.”

**Relentless Pursuit of Perfectionism:** “It’s a mindset...it’s not about
perfectionism at all costs, it’s about creating an environment in which people
refuse to accept mediocrity.”

**Integrity:** “True integrity, a sense of knowing who you are and being guided
by your own clear sense of right and wrong is a kind of secret leadership
weapon. If you trust your own instincts and treat people with respect, the
company will come to represent the values you live by.”

Particularly fascinating insights come through his descriptions of handling
important relationships.

For example, he devotes a lot of time to describing the influence of the
legendary head of ABC’s Sports and News departments Roone Arledge who served as
a demanding mentor before ultimately working for Iger, who had risen rapidly
through the ranks to increasingly senior positions. Iger’s description of how he
coaxed a last great project from an initially reluctant Arledge (ABC’s Millenium
coverage) through a combination of firmness and sensitivity is a superb insight
into the importance of emotional intelligence when leading others.

Other highlights include descriptions of Iger’s close relationship with Steve
Jobs and his exploration of the complexities involved with being acquired by and
then later acquiring other companies.

### How this book can help you

The ten principles of leadership are a great framework for anyone who finds
themselves responsible for other people. But the underlying takeaway comes from
Iger’s emphasis on the importance of consistently doing the ‘right thing’, even
when the short term consequence is negative. By following his principles, acting
with humility and treating those around him with respect, Iger was able to build
a hugely successful career while maintaining a clear conscience. Iger also
identified and executed on three core focus areas as he became CEO of Disney:

1. Increase the amount of high-quality branded content
2. Advance technologically
3. Grow globally His explanation about how he landed on this approach provides a
   great lesson in the power of taking the time to create a thoughtful strategy
   and then sticking to it, rather than constantly reacting to events.
