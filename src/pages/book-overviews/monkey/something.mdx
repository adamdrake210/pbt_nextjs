author: 'Cal Newport'
summary:
  'Deep Work by Cal Newport reads like a manifesto on the life-changing power of
  learning to work in a state of flow. Split into two sections - The Idea and
  The Rules - Newport frequently refers to examples from his own life as
  associate professor of computer science at Georgetown University to make a
  case for the value of working deeply, before spelling out exactly how to do
  it.'
