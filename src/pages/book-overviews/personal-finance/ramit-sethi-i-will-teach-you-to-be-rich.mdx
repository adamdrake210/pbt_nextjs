summary:
  'Firstly, you need to get past the title. Although I WIll Teach You to Be Rich
  is a book about finance, being rich in Ramit Sethi’s world is about far more
  than having a lot of money. Rich means designing your lifestyle so that you
  can spend time and resources on the things that are important to you.'

## Summary of main ideas

That’s a worthy goal. To get there, you need to take control of your financial
life. If you don’t know much, or anything, about personal finance. This book is
the place to start.

Sethi lays out a six-week gameplan. In reality, you don’t need to follow each
step in succession, but each stage builds on the previous one to take you on a
journey from free-spending financial illiterate to disciplined (and relaxed)
investor on the path to building wealth while enjoying life along the way.

Among other things, you will learn how to do the following (and why)

- **Optimize Your Credit Cards** - While many people get into financial trouble
  because of costly late payment fees, credit cards can actually be put to work
  in your favour to build up your credit score and earn points towards travel.
- **Adopt a Conscious Spending Plan** - Sethi argues that trying to stick to a
  budget is unrealistic for most people, who may start with good intentions but
  will eventually give up. He proposes an approach where you automatically
  deduct fixed costs and savings and then use the remainder for guilt-free
  spending.
- **Automate Everything** - An important concept that runs throughout the book:
  The less you actually have to do to manage your finances, the more chance that
  your finances will be managed!
- **Start Investing** - For anybody who hasn’t heard of Compound Interest or the
  concept of managed vs non-managed investment funds, this section is essential
  reading. Or, more simply: “Spend extravagantly on the things you love. Cut
  costs mercilessly on the things you don’t.”

## How this book can help you

There are many great books about personal finance but I Will Teach You to be
Rich is the one I wish I could go back in time and force my teenage self to
read. It changed my financial life as an early thirty-something, mainly because
it revolutionised my understanding of money.

Early on in my adult life, I saw money as a means of paying bills and buying
stuff with anything left over. I hated talking (or being talked to) about money,
it felt like a hugely complicated subject, especially as my bank account had a
magical ability to stay at a similar level for years on end. I was squeamish
about negotiating salaries and I assumed buying property would be a great idea,
if only I could somehow afford it (I’m not saying it isn’t, but it depends).

Sethi made me realise money is simply a resource that can enable you to spend
time doing what you love. With that perspective, time can be considered just
as - if not more - valuable, and money’s greatest value is often that it buys
you time. He also made me understand that the basics to getting your finances
under control are really quite simple.

I will always be grateful to this book for pushing me to automate as much of my
financial life as possible, helping me understand the importance of getting paid
fairly, and introducing me to the concepts of compound interest and index fund
investing. Less specifically, I think I can attribute some credit to I Will
Teach You to Be Rich to helping me develop a Growth Mindset, although there are
many books that have helped with that particular journey!
