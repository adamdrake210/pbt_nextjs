## Summary of main ideas

Never Split The Difference is an entertaining and practical insight into the art
of negotiation based on the experiences of former FBI Hostage Negotiator Chris
Voss who has since put his skills to work in the world of business.

Going against some of accepted best practices of negotiation that form the basis
of other books about negotiation - such as
[Getting to Yes](https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Yes-Negotiating-Agreement-Without/dp/0140157352)
by Roger Fisher - Voss puts great importance on empathising with the person on
the other side of a negotiation.

In doing so, he lays out the tactics that have served him so well throughout his
career, providing examples and explanations along the way. These include
concepts such as:

**Active Listening:** Listening provides an inexpensive way of granting a
concession to the other party, demonstrating that you are taking their needs
seriously and genuinely want to understand their perspective. It requires 100%
focus on what the other person is saying and the discipline to repress any
thoughts related to your existing assumptions and worldview.

As well as building trust, active listening helps to build a sense of the other
person’s perspective, which provides a negotiation advantage.

**Mirroring:** Voss describes mirroring as a “magical technique” that
facilitates bonding with the other person. By repeating somebody’s words back to
them you can harness the power of similarity while gently inducing them to
elaborate and provide more information, which is perhaps the most crucial aspect
of any negotiation.

**Labeling:** Giving someone’s emotion a name reduces the negativity of that
emotion or reinforces the positivity. Using phrases such as “it seems like
you...” or “it looks like you...” demonstrates that you understand and care
about the other person’s feelings. By acknowledging these emotions, you remove
their explosive power and open a channel to address them.

**Leveraging ‘no’:** Voss argues that getting a ‘no’ out of the other person
early on in a negotiation is crucial because it allows him or her to feel a
sense of control within the situation. It is also a much more trustworthy answer
than ‘yes’, which will often not be truthful. ‘No’ provides a platform from
which to start the real negotiation by asking solution-based questions such as
“How do we move forward from here?”

**Getting to ‘that’s right’:** When there is an impasse (or the risk of one) in
a negotiation, getting the other person to say “that’s right” is key to moving
things along. In Voss’ own words: “That's right is what we say when we feel
completely heard, and there's a chemical change that takes place in our brain —
it is a subtle epiphany. And when you feel an epiphany, you feel better, you
just don't know where it came from.”

The best way of leading the other person in the negotiation to a “that’s right”
is to summarise their arguments and feelings (labels!) so well that “that’s
right” becomes the only logical response.

**Finding the Black Swan:** Black swans are hidden pieces of information with
the power to dramatically change the course of a negotiation, because they are
“leverage multipliers.” Voss argues that great negotiators are skilled at
uncovering this black swan if it exists. It requires a deep level of empathy to
connect with your counterpart to understand their worldview and emotions. This
is where the black swan is most likely to be found.

The book is full of very specific tactics and insights that the reader can
quickly begin to apply in their own life. Voss also introduces concepts such as:

- The three types of voice tone a negotiator should adopt

  - The late night FM dj voice
  - The positive/playful voice
  - The direct or assertive voice

- The three types of leverage

  - Positive
  - Negative
  - Normative

- The three kinds of yes
  - Counterfeit
  - Confirmation
  - Commitment

But the book’s overarching takeaway is quite simple. Deploy deep empathy to
build trust and gain valuable information to help you achieve the best possible
outcome in a negotiation.

## How this book can help you

You don’t need to work in hostage negotiation to get a lot of value from Never
Split the Difference. The tactics and examples used by Voss are so specific and
well-explained that anyone who routinely finds themselves in some kind of
negotiation with colleagues, customers, relatives or friends (so everyone,
really) can begin applying them to real life situations

For sure, people facing typical negotiation scenarios such as asking for a raise
will gain a lot from this book. It breaks down situations that are often
intimidating and awkward and provides proven tools for getting an edge
(especially when the person on the other side of the table hasn’t been trained
in negotiation skills!).

But it’s also a valuable toolkit for dealing with non-confrontational contexts
as well. Learning how to listen actively will help anyone build better
relationships and trying to understand the emotions and perspectives of other
people is a crucial skill that will lead to success not only in business but
also in life.
