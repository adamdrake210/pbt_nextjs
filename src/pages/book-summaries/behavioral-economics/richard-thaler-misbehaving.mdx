title: 'Misbehaving: The Making of Behavioral Economics'
description:
  'Read Misbehaving by Richard Thaler for an introduction to the exciting world
  of Behavioral Economics and learn about how human decision-making is usually
  anything but rational.'
author: 'Richard Thaler'
intro:
  'Misbehaving is a guided tour through the emergence of Behavioral Economics as
  a serious economic discipline, written by one of its most respected figures.
  The title relates to Thaler’s core theme: people do not act in the ultra
  rational way that traditional economic theory assumes. Instead, they
  ‘misbehave’ by making irrational decisions in predictable ways. This is the
  story of a sometimes vicious battle between traditional economists and the
  growing school of behavioral economists to which Thaler belongs, told in an
  understandable way with a good dose of humour thrown in as well.'

## Summary of main ideas

Perhaps the most important character in Misbehaving is not a person but an
invented species. ‘Homo economicus’ - affectionately shortened to ‘Econ’ - is
like a real human in every respect, except for being perfectly rational,
self-interested and capable of making optimal decisions.

As Thaler puts it: “The purely economic man is indeed close to being a social
moron. Economic theory has been much preoccupied with this rational fool.”

Economists have traditionally based their theories on the assumption that human
beings are completely rational agents, compelling critics to coin the Econ term.
As a graduate student in the 1970s Thaler began to keep a note of his regular
observations of human behaviour differing substantially from the behaviour
expected by economists.

One example. Early in his teaching career, Thaler set a particularly difficult
exam for his students in order to separate the extremely capable from the rest.
This led to an average score of 72 out of 100 and caused “uproar” among his
students who complained the exam was too hard.

Because the score was graded on a curve, the average score did not actually
affect the distribution of the grades, but this failed to appease the angry
students. Thaler’s solution was to tweak the next exam to make the total number
of available points 137 instead of 100. The next exam was even harder but,
because the average score was 97, the students were happy.

If humans really were perfectly rational beings, then they should not have cared
about the points available. And if humans didn’t behave rationally in the way
that economists believed, could these theories be flawed?

Other people were asking the same questions. Throughout Misbehaving, Thaler
introduces us to a stellar cast of Behavioral Economics thinkers including
Daniel Kahneman (author of
[Thinking Fast and Slow](https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=Thinking+Fast+and+Slow&qid=1595680819&s=books&sr=1-1)),
Amon Taversky (Kahneman’s long-time collaborator), Cass Sunstein (co-author of
[Nudge](https://www.amazon.com/Nudge-Improving-Decisions-Health-Happiness/dp/014311526X)
along with Thaler) and many more who led the fight against a powerful opposition
in the form of traditional economists, wedded to their theories.

Thaler also introduces a series of concepts that demonstrate the difference
between Econs and real humans. A few (but certainly not all) of these include:

**Prospect Theory**

Prospect Theory was formulated by Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman and is
regarded as one of the founding pillars of Behavioral Economics. Designed to
describe the behaviour of actual people, the theory demonstrates how individuals
consider loss and gain in an asymmetrical way.

For example, consider options for gaining
$100. For the first option, you are given $200 initially and then you lose
$100. For the second option you just are just given $100. Econs would not care
about which option happened to them because the ultimate
[‘utility’](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility) is the same in both cases.
But, real people prefer the second option because they feel losses more strongly
than gains.

For a good overview of Prospect Theory,
[check out this article on Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/prospecttheory.asp).

**The Endowment Effect**

Coined by Thaler in 1980, the Endowment Effect can be seen as an extension of
Prospect Theory because it builds on the concept of loss aversion. It also
relates to the Mere Ownership Paradigm, which is based on the idea that people
give higher valuations to items they own compared to valuations of the same
items made by people who do not own them.

A real world application of the Endowment Effect can be seen in marketing, where
tactics such as free trials and test drives are used to give potential customers
a sense of ownership of a product or service that they don’t yet own.

This video gives a good short overview of the Endowment Effect using the famous
example of an experiment in which a group of people were given a coffee mug and
asked how much they would be willing to sell the mug for while taking another
group of people, not giving them the same mug, but asking them how much they
would be willing to pay for one. The results showed that the mug owners valued
the mugs almost double compared to the non-owners’ valuations.

**Transactional Utility**

Transactional Utility is one of several Mental Accounting concepts introduced by
Thaler in Misbehaving. It relates to the perceived value of getting a good deal
based on the difference between what an individual pays and their reference
price for the item.

This video provides a good example of Transactional Utility at work.

## How this book can help you

Misbehaving is an ideal entry point for people who are interested in learning
about Behavioral Economics. Thaler’s clear and humorous explanations make the
subject matter accessible and relevant to real world scenarios. By structuring
Misbehaving as an (almost) chronological history, Thaler does a great job of
placing the emergence of Behavioral Economics into a wider context of a changing
real and academic world.

More generally, I think that building an understanding of this topic is
important because it relates to so many areas of life, from understanding our
own tendencies to make bad or illogical decisions, through to how we can relate
to and influence other people. It’s not always easy, and I’m sure there are
concepts and ideas that I will need to revisit (and this is after having already
read Thinking Fast and Slow twice!) but, as one Audible reviewer put it very
succinctly, “this book made me smarter.”

## Some good further reading/watching/listening

Watch Richard Thaler in conversation with Google’s Chief Economist Hal Varian.

As well as Thinking Fast and Slow, I also recommend reading Michael Lewis'
[The Undoing Project: A Friendship That Changed Our Minds](https://www.amazon.com/Undoing-Project-Friendship-Changed-Minds/dp/0393354776/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=the+undoing+project&qid=1595682838&s=books&sr=1-1)
which tells the story of the birth of Behavioral Economics through the prism of
Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky's friendship and
[The Victory Lab: The Secret Science of Winning Campaigns](https://www.amazon.com/Victory-Lab-Science-Winning-Campaigns/dp/0307954803)
by Sasha Issenberg, which takes you into the world of politics and shows the
gradual impact of behavioral economics and data on the science of winning
elections.
