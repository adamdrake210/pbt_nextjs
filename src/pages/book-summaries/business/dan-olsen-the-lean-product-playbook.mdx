## In a nutshell description

The Lean Product Playbook provides a framework to approaching product development, building on the core values established in Eric Ries’ groundbreaking work: The Lean Startup.

Author Dan Olsen repeatedly emphasises the importance of finding product-market fit quickly and efficiently.

In particular, Olsen’s [Product-Market Fit Pyramid and six-step Lean Product Process](https://leanstartup.co/a-playbook-for-achieving-product-market-fit/#:~:text=The%20Product%2DMarket%20Fit%20Pyramid%20is%20an%20actionable%20model%20that,fit%20using%20five%20key%20components.&text=From%20bottom%20to%20top%2C%20the,your%20user%20experience%20(UX)) provide actionable guidelines with which to approach building a product that will delight customers. Finding and solving customer problems underpins everything in this book, with the need for rapid feedback and iteration also a constant theme. 


> “The main reason products fail is because they don't meet customer needs in a way that is better than other alternatives.” - Dan Olsen

## Quotes to make you think

“A good product is designed with focus on the set of needs that are important and that make sense to address together.”

“Focus is critical when defining a new product.”

“The real-world manifestation of software products that customers see and use is the user experience (UX), which is the top layer of the Product-Market Fit Pyramid. Beyond software, this is also true for any product with which the customer interacts. The UX is what brings a product's functionality to life for the user.”

“The main reason products fail is because they don't meet customer needs in a way that is better than other alternatives.”

“Usability answers the question, “Can customers use your product?” Delight answers the question, “Do customers enjoy using your product?”

## Why I love this book

I read The Lean Product Playbook at the right time, just as I began to spend a large part of my working life building products. 

I loved how clearly Olsen set out a process towards building products with tools that I could take away and apply to my own work.

It turns out that it’s more difficult in practice to stick to the Lean Product Process than I had expected, and I’ve learnt the hard way about the risks of pressing ahead without user feedback. The experience has made me even more convinced that everyone involved in product development should read this book (if ever there has been a book that I wish I could force colleagues to read, this is it!). 

## Read this book if…

You are involved with developing products at any level. The obvious use case relates to products designed for consumers, but the underlying philosophy applies to a much wider range of scenarios at work. For example, if you are tasked with creating reports for management, The principles and tools in The Lean Product Playbook will help you make a success of it.
