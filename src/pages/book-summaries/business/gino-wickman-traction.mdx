## Summary of main ideas

The EOS system comprises six core components, which Wickman explores with chapters
dedicated to each.

**Vision:** This section is about establishing the focus of your organisation
and getting everyone onboard. Wickman outlines eight questions that form the
basis for creating a coherent vision. This is the starting point for everything
else.

**People:** Wickman frequently emphasises the importance of getting “the right
people in the right seats” and why achieving one out of the two doesn’t work.

**Data:** This is not simply a call to adopt a data-driven approach, but
recommends identifying a small group of metrics that enable leadership to truly
understand how the business is performing. The most important metrics can change
over time as the context evolves.

**Issues:** This component accepts that all businesses encounter issues and that
successful businesses need to be very competent and proactive problem solving
machines. This requires systems for identifying and addressing issues while
cultivating a culture that encourages people to come forward with issues without
fear of punishment.

**Process:** How to actually build the systems that will drive a successful
business, from process documentation to ensuring that people follow them.

**Traction:** This component relates to the execution of the system. In this
section, Wickman goes into depth about the use of ‘Rocks’ - the three to seven
most important things to accomplish in the next 90 days - and the ‘Meeting
Pulse’ - highly structured weekly meetings that are designed to ensure the
company is constantly moving in the right direction.

Within each of the core components, Wickman introduces a series of tools and
tactics that he has employed throughout his career of helping businesses to
implement the EOS system. The end result is an intuitive playbook for
transforming a reactive or lacklustre business into a coherent, efficient and
ultimately successful organisation.

## How this book can help you

Traction offers a set of steps that are easy to understand, intuitive and
straight-forward to implement (with a lot of time and energy). I think it’s the
ideal starting point for new business owners as well as experienced
entrepreneurs who want to grow their businesses. But it’s not just for business
owners. The concepts described in this book can be applied to all kinds of
contexts. You could use rocks as a tool to laser focus your individual goals in
a corporate job or find the most important metrics to keep track of your health.

I can completely understand why Traction has been an inspiration to many of its
readers, every concept and tool makes sense and it feels like a genuinely
overarching solution (although with the caveat that this book doesn’t offer deep
guidance on how to acquire and keep customers or the best approach to product
development etc). However, it’s important to note that just reading the book is
not sufficient! Applying the concepts will take a lot of work, with trial and
error to discover what works for you and what doesn’t.
