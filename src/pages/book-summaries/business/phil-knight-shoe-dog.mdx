## Summary of main ideas

In many ways, Shoe Dog is a typical biography in the sense that Knight takes the
reader on a chronological journey through his life.

Phil Knight was born in 1938 and grew up in Portland. He developed a love for
athletics, competing as a middle-distance runner for the University of Oregan.
While still a student, he wrote a paper on a potential business opportunity for
selling Japanese shoes in the United States, having witnessed the impact of
Japanese cars on the American automotive industry.

After college, while traveling around the world, Knight decided on an impulse to
set up a meeting with a shoe manufacturing company called Onitsuka when he
visited Japan. Believing he represented an established American company, the
Japanese agreed to the meeting and agreed to let Knight distribute their shoes
in America as they were keen to enter the market.

From placing his first order for a few thousand pairs of shoes, Knight’s
company - originally called Blue Ribbon - grew into what became Nike.

However, the journey was rarely plain sailing. Knight describes how he leaned on
the support of his running coach and eventual business partner Bill Bowerman as
the company struggled early on to develop running shoes that were better than
their competitors'. Problems arose as these competitors searched for ways to
eliminate this young rival, even resorting to using the US Government as an
almost insurmountable obstacle.

As Nike grew into a global powerhouse, the challenges remained in different
forms. Knight describes some of the key milestones in the company’s early
history, from struggling to get enough credit to grow the company to the
thinking behind the famous deal to sign basketball legend Michael Jordan in 1984
as well as the story behind the creation of the famous Nike logo.

But Shoe Dog is more than just a typical biography. Several themes emerge
throughout the book that serve as valuable insights into how to run a business
and build your life around a passion.

**Throw yourself in at the deep end** Knight started as he meant to go on when
he walked into that first meeting in Japan. He wasn’t ready but he saw an
opportunity and made it work. He took this attitude and applied it to building
his company, always finding a way to overcome the many significant obstacles in
his way.

**Find great people and then leave them alone to do great things** In Knight’s
own words: “Don’t tell people how to do things, tell them what to do and let
them surprise you with their results.”

**Perseverance is incredibly powerful** Another quote from the book: “So that
morning in 1962 I told myself: Let everyone else call your idea crazy . . . just
keep going. Don’t stop. Don’t even think about stopping until you get there, and
don’t give much thought to where “there” is. Whatever comes, just don’t stop.”

**Build and maintain great relationships** The importance Knight places on
relationships with his colleagues as well as the many sports stars affiliated
with Nike is apparent throughout Shoe Dog. Having remained friends with almost
everyone who helped him start the business, he is at pains to demonstrate the
importance the contributions of others had in the growth of Nike, a direct
consequence of his emphasis on treating people well.

## How this book can help you

Shoe Dog surprised me because I was expecting an interesting story about Nike
but the book turned out to be much more than that. For a start, it was enjoyable
to read thanks to Phil Knight’s entertaining and humble storytelling style.

This is certainly a particularly relevant book for business leaders and aspiring
entrepreneurs. I would go further to suggest that anyone aiming to improve their
career or find a way to turn their passion into their daily life will benefit
from reading this. Especially in relation to the bravery and (some might say)
cheek that Knight showed when getting his business off the ground by arranging a
meeting that he was not qualified for. He saw an opportunity, made something out
of it and then became increasingly successful by sheer force of will.

I wish this book had existed twenty years ago!
