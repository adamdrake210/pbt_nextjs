## Summary of main ideas

You can breathe in as many different ways as different foods you can eat however
it is estimated that around 90% are breathing either incorrectly or not
efficiently. There are many modern day maladies that stem from not breathing
properly ranging from asthma, anxiety, sleep apnea, snoring, ADHD and even
cardiovascular diseases.

James embarks on his own journey by participating in a 20 day experiment with a
quirky and enthusiastic Swedish scientist named Anders Olsson. Anders is
obsessed with breathing and spent a decade studying the difference between mouth
breathing and nose breathing.

The idea of the experiment was to spend the first 10 days mouth breathing only
and the next 10 days nose breathing. Many tests were done during these
experiments to gain insight into the effects of boths methods of breathing. The
results were alarming and it led James on a world wide tour to rediscover the
art of breathing that certain ancient civilisations practised.

James breaks down the methods he discovered into 7 steps that you can
incorporate into your daily life.

**Step 1: Shut Your Mouth**

James’s experiment breathing 10 days just through his mouth and then 10 days
just through his nose showed just how bad for you breathing through your mouth
is. Stress hormones spiked, he acquired a bacterial bug in his nose, blood
pressure was through the roof and heart rate variability plummeted.

Ander’s and his snoring increased at night and they both suffered from bouts of
sleep apnea. Certain blood markers however stayed the same which would explain
why many people are chronic mouth breathers but don’t notice anything seriously
wrong. It seems to be more of a very slow killer that decreases quality of life
along the way but to a level that people accept as normal.

**Step 2: Breath through your nose**

When they did breath through their noses both James’s and Olsen’s blood
pressures, heart rates and carbon dioxide levels normalised. Snoring decreased
from several hours to mins each night. James practised taping his mouth shut
every night to force himself to breath through his nose when he was asleep and
reported feeling much better afterwards. There are now clinical trials happening
investigating this practise and the benefits it could bring.

**Step 3: Exhale**

[Carl Stough](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Stough) spent his lifetime
teaching people how to get stale air out of their bodies so they could get more
fresh air in. He trained his clients to exhale longer and this had miraculous
effects on emphysema patients, Opera singers and professional athletes. Most of
us only use a small percentage of our lung capacity but the first stages of
healthy breathing is to extend these breaths and get the diaphragm working.

**Step 4: Chew**

James on his worldly travels investigated skulls from different periods to see
what differences he could find. He found that pre-industrial skulls have three
main features - huge sinus cavities, straight teeth and strong jaws. These three
features would have helped our ancestors breath much easier than we do today.
The reason our ancestors had these features comes down to a few reasons but one
main one is the food they ate. They used to spend hours chewing.

They lived before our food became processed and mushy and therefore had to chew
their food properly in order to digest it. The bones in our face can continually
grow throughout our lives. Your diet should consist of food that requires much
time chewing. And when not chewing your lips should remain together, your teeth
slightly touching and your tongue on the roof of your mouth.

**Step 5: Breath More on Occasion**

Practise something like
[Tummo Breathing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XtDgQZbiFc),
[Wim Hof breathing method](https://www.wimhofmethod.com/) and
[vigorous pranayamas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVchZ8D15Ec) on occasion.
They stress the body and snap it out of its funk so it can properly function for
the other 23.5 hours of the day. Conscious breathing teaches us to be the pilots
of our bodies.

**Step 6. Hold Your Breath**

[Doctor Donald Klein](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/16/science/donald-klein-dead.html)
studied links between chemoreceptor flexibility, carbon dioxide and anxiety. His
research has led to discoveries linking certain parts of the brain to breathing
and how breathing can be used to treat certain fears and anxieties.

**Step 7: How we Breathe Matters**

The perfect breath is this: Breathe in for 5.5 seconds. Breathe out for 5.5
seconds. That’s 5.5 breaths a minute and 5.5 litres of air. You can practise
this method of breathing for a few minutes or a few hours. It is also (through
no coincidence) the length of time that many prayers or religious chants take.

It seems the body responds very well to this way of breathing and this has been
discovered over and over again throughout the ages.

## What can you get out of this book

30 lbs of air that pass through our lungs everyday and the way we breathe is
just as important as the food we eat or the exercise we do. James has broken
down the art of breathing into very simple and doable steps.

These steps can be incorporated into your daily life very simply and that is why
I like this book so much. Simply by shutting your mouth when not talking can
have wondrous effects on your long term well being. Chewing your food properly
when eating can actually change physical bone structures in your face. By
practising certain breathing exercises you can take charge of your body.

With levels of depression and anxiety apparently at an all time high I think it
is time as a species we looked at the most basic functions of our lives such as
breathing. If we can focus on this and do this well then I firmly believe we can
build a solid foundation on which we can live healthy happy lives.
