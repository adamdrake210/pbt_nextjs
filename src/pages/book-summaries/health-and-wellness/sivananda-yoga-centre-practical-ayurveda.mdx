Practical Ayurveda. - _Amazon Product Description_

## In a nutshell description

This is a practical book explaining what Ayurveda is and how to bring it into
your life. Ayurveda is the Science of long living and a healthy life.

**Ayuhu** = longevity, span of life. **Veda** = branch of knowledge.

The book starts off by explaining about the four aspects of the body (Doshas,
Agni, Dhatus, Malas). It leads you through to discover what kind of body
constitution you have and then dives more into detail about each body type. It
then goes into Lifestyle talking about daily routines and looking after your
body.

It then goes quite deeply into the food and diet aspect of Ayurveda and how
different diets suit different body constitutions and how the seasons play a
very important role in how our bodies are.

Next it brings exercises and focuses predominantly on Yoga. It lays out
different Asanas and an explanation on the benefits each one brings. It
introduces breathing exercises too and how incredibly important the breath is to
a healthy organism.

Finally it comes to the mind and how to introduce positive thinking and
meditation into your life. This is another type of Yoga (raja Yoga) and how it
can bring balance and harmony into our lives.

There is so much information packed into this book and it is filled with
wonderful illustrations. It’s a book that really justifies having the hard copy.

## Quotes to make you think

Life is meant for service and not for self-seeking. Hold your life of the
service of others. The more energy you expend in elevating others, the more
universal energy will flow into you.

## Why I love this book

I really like this book because the approach of Ayurveda just makes so much
sense to me. This isn’t a one size fits all approach, it’s about understanding
yourself and your body and then applying the specific suggestions to what works
for you. It made me aware of so many aspects of myself that I somehow knew but
never formulated into specific thoughts.

The part about the different body types and the energies within the body and how
everyone has different combinations of these was a revelation to me. It really
made me look at people around me differently, I saw them all in a new light.

There is also a section I really liked - ‘Looking after your body’ which lists
ten practises you can do in the morning. Things like clearing your nasal
passage, cleaning your tongue, inhaling aromas… simple practises but when
combined together over a period of time they really made a difference in how I
generally felt.

I still have much to learn from this book and about Ayurveda but this book gives
such a great introduction and really opened my eyes about many aspects of life.

## Read this book if…

I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to gain a deeper insight into
themselves and their mind and bodies. Personally I think this will be helpful
for anyone but I also understand you have to be in a certain place in life to
really absorb and appreciate what is written here.

There is a great deal of information in this book so it’s definitely a book you
can keep coming back to. However, even just reading a section at a time can
really have an influence on how you see yourself.

## Some good further reading/watching/listening
