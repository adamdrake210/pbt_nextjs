## In a nutshell description

Albert Speer: His Battle With Truth is a detailed journey into the life and morality 
of Albert Speer, the German architect who famously rose within Nazi Germany to become 
Hitler’s Minister of Armaments and Munitions as well as an initmate member of his 
inner circle.

Late author Gitta Sereny meticulously maps out Speer’s ascent from his early beginnings 
to his ascent to the highest echelons of the Third Reich before a post-war life in which 
he portrayed himself as ‘the good Nazi’.

And this is where the book is particularly interesting. Speer - especially after the completion 
of his 20 year imprisonment at Spandau prison - presented himself as an articulate, educated and 
apologetic victim of circumstance. Crucially, he claimed to having not known anything about the 
very worst Nazi crimes, including the systematic killing of over six million Jewish people during 
what became known as The Holocaust.

As part of her research, Sereny came to know Speer personally and admitted to liking him. But was 
he really telling the truth when insisting that he didn’t know anything about the Final Solution?
Sereny’s conclusion is almost reluctant but firm: He did know and history should judge him accordingly.

> “If one wanted to gain real understanding of Speer, one had to realize first that almost everything 
> he did–though, as shown by some of our talks, not quite everything–had a purpose, generally directed 
> towards his own benefit.” - Gitta Sereny

## Quotes to make you think

“Most Hitler biographers are dismissive of his emotional capacities. The general trend has been to see him 
as cold and incapable of compassion. But while this certainly applies to his political self, more recent 
research suggests that he was neither cold nor indifferent towards those closest to him, and this certainly 
included Speer.”

“If one wanted to gain real understanding of Speer, one had to realize first that almost everything he did–though, 
as shown by some of our talks, not quite everything–had a purpose, generally directed towards his own benefit.”

“What Hitler taught us–to an extent greater than anyone else in history, though we would become aware of it again 
in Vietnam–is that a licence to kill creates a momentum which defies moral sensibility and discernment and destroys 
the capacity of the individual to distinguish between good and evil or, and this is perhaps even worse, to act against 
a recognized wrong.”


## Why I love this book

I read Albert Speer: His Battle with Truth more than a decade ago. Having studied Nazi Germany in some depth throughout 
school and university, this was the first time I had actively sought out and purchased a book on the subject for the 
sake of wanting to learn more rather than with an exam or essay at the back of my mind. I took my time and immersed myself 
in the details.

Sereny’s forensic investigation of events, descriptions of the Nazi context and exploration of Speer’s character captivated 
me from the beginning and compelled me to try to empahise with his experiences on a human level. It was perhaps the first time 
I had considered the famous Nazi protagonists as real people rather than evil caricatures.

I almost found myself hoping Sereny would reach the conclusion that Speer really was just a normal person who was unfortunate 
to have been born in the wrong place at the wrong time. Her assertion that Speer had known about the extermination of the Jews 
felt even more powerful as a result.

## Read this book if…

You are interested by the history of Nazi Germany and want to learn more about that period of time (partly) while contemplating 
the ambiguous nature of good and evil.

## What others day about it

“Arguably the most important and certainly the most fascinating book about the Nazi era published in the last ten years” 
— **Robert Harris** (note, Albert Speer: His Battle With Truth was published in 1995) 

“A masterpiece of historical and inquisitorial technique, enables us to understand the ablest, most articulate, and most 
ambiguous of Hitler’s ministers”  — **Hugh Trevor-Roper**

[“Relentlessly and repeatedly, Sereny shows that Speer must have known more about the fate of the Jews, the realities of the 
concentration camps, and the treatment of foreign workers than he ever admitted. Yet she shows a kind of overall indulgence and 
tells us that she saw in Speer's battle with himself…”](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/1996-03-01/albert-speer-his-battle-truth)
