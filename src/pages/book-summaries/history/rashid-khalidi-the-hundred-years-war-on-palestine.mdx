## Summary of main ideas

Khalidi focuses on six key events, or ‘declarations of war’, to lay out his
argument that the history of Palestine and Israel since the start of the 20th
century amounts to a “colonial war waged against the indigenous population, by a
variety of parties, to force them to relinquish their homeland to another people
against their will.”

This “variety of parties” includes the Israelis, the Palestinians, the British
and the Americans. Throughout, Khalidi shows how the mistakes and failings of
these stakeholders both created and perpetuated the conflict.

**The First Declaration Of War: 1917-1939**

In The First Declaration Of War, Khalidi describes how conditions were set for
the eventual establishment of the state of Israel in 1948. In the
[Balfour Declaration of 1917](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl1d4WyleY4),
Britain had committed to supporting the establishment of a "national home for
the Jewish people” in Palestine, even though the Arab population made up 94% of
the total population of Palestine at the time.

The consequences were disastrous. The
[1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1936%E2%80%931939_Arab_revolt_in_Palestine)
against increased Jewish immigration was disorganised, unsavoury (with the
[Grand Mufti of Jerusalem pursuing an alliance with Nazi Germany](https://www.timesofisrael.com/full-official-record-what-the-mufti-said-to-hitler/))
and ultimately unsuccessful.

**The Second Declaration Of War: 1947-1948**

This section focuses on the
[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Partition_Plan_for_Palestine#:~:text=The%20United%20Nations%20Partition%20Plan,as%20Resolution%20181%20(II).>)
which was adopted as Resolution 181 and recommended the creation of independent
Arab and Jewish States.

This led to civil war followed by the declaration of the establishment of the
state of Israel leading to the surrounding Arab states invading. The invasion
was unsuccessful. By the end of the war, 700,000 Palestinian Arabs had either
fled from their homes or were expelled from the area that became Israel,
starting a refugee crisis that has never been resolved.

**The Third Declaration Of War: 1967**

In The Third Declaration Of War, Khalidi explores the
[Six-Day War of 1967](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHqJ6pgdE-c) and
especially the
[UN Security Council (SC) Resolution 242](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_242)
which, partly due to some linguistic ambiguity between the French and English
versions, did not force Israel to withdraw from newly occupied territories. As
with Resolution 181, Resolution 242 made no reference to Palistinians (referring
only to the ‘refugee problem’.

This is a theme returned to frequently by Khalidi: he argues that the
Palestinian people have been repeatedly ignored as stakeholders in Arab-Israeli
conflict putting the rights and welfare of the Palestinian people at a continual
disadvantage.

**The Fourth Declaration Of War: 1982**

This section centers on the
[Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1982_Lebanon_War)
which, Khalidi argues, represented a joint Israeli-American operation. The
invasion sought to wipe out Palestinian nationalism in the occupied West Bank
and Gaza.

15,000 - 20,000 people were killed, of which a high proportion were civilians.
The emergence of the United States as Israel’s partner in “helping to repress
the Palestinians by force in service of Zionist ends,” is another key theme that
Khalidi addresses in detail in this section.

**The Fifth Declaration Of War: 1987-1995**

[The First Palestinian Intifada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Intifada),
which began in 1987, saw an outbreak of Palestinian protests and riots against
the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza. The Israeli response was
widely seen as disproportionate in its brutality, which led to a rise in
sympathy for the Palestinian cause around the world.

Khalidi explores the subsequent self-inflicted damage inflicted by the PLO
leadership in squandering this public support and then accepting a flawed
outcome at the [Oslo Accords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo_I_Accord) of
1993 that was at least partly a result of naive and inexperienced PLO
negotiation.

**The Sixth Declaration Of War: 2000-2014**

The final declaration identified by Khalidi spans fourteen years and encompasses
[the Second Palestinian Intifada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Aqsa_Intifada)
and Israel’s aggressive response to it as well as the three Israeli Defence
Forces assaults on the Gaza Strip in 2008, 2012 and 2014.

Khalidi examines the nature of this response, in particular its impact on
Palestinian civilians. He argues that these extreme measures can be considered
“crimes against humanity” and, once more, highlights the influence of the USA in
providing weapons and machinery.

## How this book can help you

I think The Hundred Years' War on Palestine essential reading for anyone who
wants to get a foundational understanding of the Arab-Israeli conflict. Here’s
why.

I studied the Arab-Israeli conflict at school and was entranced by the subject,
although I realised even then that I had only scratched the surface. Since then,
I’ve learnt more about the Middle East and come to understand that so many
global events can be traced back to the establishment of Israel and the fight
for Palestine.

The more I learnt, the greater my realisation that there was a large gap in my
knowledge concerning the origins of the conflict. The Hundred Years' War on
Palestine was an ideal step towards building a greater understanding because
Khalidi thoroughly describes the key events while also providing commentary
based on a well of knowledge and personal experience.

I expect some people will consider Khalidi’s work biased in favour of the
Palestinian version of events. I don’t feel qualified to judge at this point but
his writing has certainly inspired me to learn more on the subject.

Khalidi said that he intended this book to serve as a counterpoint to the
popular mythology made famous by Leon Uris’ epic
[Exodus[(https://www.amazon.com/Exodus-Novel-Israel-Leon-Uris/dp/0553258478/ref=as_li_ss_tl?dchild=1&keywords=Exodus&qid=1601310175&sr=8-2&linkCode=ll1&tag=paperbacktrav-20&linkId=534b1b4f959d2a50238c3859dcbfac65&language=en_US)
(which I enjoyed reading but clearly represents a very biased point of view) and
I think the major takeaway for an audience that isn’t steeped in the history of
the Arab-Israeli conflict is the understanding that it isn’t a clear history of
good vs evil but rather a desperately sad story of innocent human suffering
stemming from decisions taken more than a century ago.
