## Summary of main ideas

So what exactly is deep work and why is it important? In a world of limitless
distractions, ranging from incoming emails and colleagues interrupting you at
your desk (admittedly more so pre-Covid!) to the temptations of jumping down the
rabbit hole of Youtube and the rest of the internet, it’s easy to find yourself
working in a ‘shallow’ way.

Newport argues that we are able to produce work of greater quality and quantity
when we succeed in reaching a state of deep concentration. You might recognise
this as ‘getting into the zone’ when working on a difficult task that requires
all of your focus. It’s a cliché that computer programmers work much more
effectively when they reach this state, but try interrupting a room full of
focused developers and you will quickly realise the cliché reflects reality!

The key takeaway from this book is that everyone can benefit from learning to
work deeply and it is important to deliberately create the conditions to make it
possible. Suggestions include breaking your day into slots on your calendar,
building routines into your daily life that force you to spend time alone with
just your thoughts for company (Newport uses long walks) and taking steps to
eliminate distractions such as social media.

## How this book can help you

Deep work is one of the most actionable books I have read. I already had a good
intuition that working in a focused way was better than getting distracted
regularly, but this really crystallised the concept and helped me understand its
importance. Personally, this was the biggest help.

Having read the book, I’ve worked in a far more focused way, which has benefited
every aspect of my life. I tested the specific tactics outlined in the book and
eventually found my own system for deep work by working in 25-minute
highly-focused ‘pomodoros'.
