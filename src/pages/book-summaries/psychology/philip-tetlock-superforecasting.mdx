intro:
  'Superforecasting tells the story of a group of ordinary people who became so
  good at making predictions they consistently outperformed so-called experts,
  professionals and entire government departments. Who are these people and why
  are they so special? According to author Philip Tetlock, superforecasting can
  be learnt and this book is his attempt to show us how.'

## Summary of main ideas

In 2011, IARPA, a US intelligence agency launched a forecasting tournament with
the aim of discovering methods of prediction that would help them to increase
the accuracy of their own forecasts.

The agency had learnt the hard way that the consequences of making bad
predictions could be catastrophic, the decision to go to war in Iraq based on
flimsy evidence being a case in point.

The Good Judgement Project, led by Philip Tetlock (the co-author of this book)
and Barbara Mellers, was one of the organisations invited to compete.
"Harnessing the wisdom of the crowd to forecast world events," the Good Judgment
Project recruited volunteers and set them a series of questions.

Four years later, the volunteers had collectively worked on 500 questions
(typically questions like "Will the president of Tunisia go into exile in the
next month?" or "Will the euro fall below \$1.20 in the next twelve months?")
and over a million forecasts. As well as emerging as the clear tournament
winner, Tetlock noticed an interesting trend among these seemingly ordinary
volunteers.

A subset of them were consistently achieving remarkable results, producing
forecasts whose accuracy outperformed intelligence analysts with access to
classified data.

What was it about these ‘superforecasters’ that made them different?

At this point, it’s worth taking a step back and mentioning Tetlock’s
background. He previously authored
[Expert Political Judgment](https://www.amazon.com/Expert-Political-Judgment-Good-Know/dp/0691175977/ref=as_li_ss_tl?dchild=1&keywords=Expert+Political+Judgment&qid=1598697171&s=books&sr=1-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=paperbacktrav-20&linkId=e8f4190172f6285205901a9819d8c3af&language=en_US),
which demonstrated that so-called experts were often wrong with their
predictions and then not held accountable. He famously concluded that dart
throwing chimpanzees would have achieved a higher success rate at predicting
future events.

Superforecasting therefore builds on the foundations of Tetlock’s previous work
to show that, while forecasting is an extremely difficult activity, there is an
art and a science to doing it well.

Superforecasters, while not completely out of the ordinary, share certain traits
and approaches that lower performers do not. In other words, they are
intelligent people but don’t need to be geniuses and ‘super’ forecasting skills
can be learned.

So what are the main characteristics of superforecasters?

**They are in ‘Perpetual Beta’**

Superforecasters work in constant feedback loops. They are hungry for new
information and use this information to regularly update their forecasts. They
understand that practice is essential to improving their forecasts.

**They are foxes rather than hedgehogs**

Related to the Perpetual Beta point, Tetlock categorises forecasters into two
groups (although like everything else in Superforecasting, this is not binary
but a continuum:

Hedgehogs are people who have a solid world-view which they reflect in their
forecasts.

Foxes are people who do not base their forecasts on one big central idea.
Instead, they aggregate many different perspectives and question their
assumptions. Superforecasters mainly come from this group

> Superforecasters understand that practice is essential to improving their
> forecasts.

**They are extremely specific**

Whereas most people would answer a question about a future event with either a
binary “yes” or “no” response, or perhaps with a “maybe” if uncertain,
superforecasters typically make their forecasts to percentage point levels of
granularity.

For example, I currently believe there is a 57% chance that Biden will beat
Trump in the 2020 election because I have seen
[predictions of 60% from sources I respect](https://www.gjopen.com/questions/1496-who-will-win-the-2020-united-states-presidential-election)
and I am naturally paranoid (and I am in no way a superforecaster!).

**They are humble**

Superforecasters are acutely aware that the human brain is prone to making
errors and they take measures to combat it. Tetlock discusses the concept of
Systems One and Two, the two modes of thought popularised in Daniel Kahneman’s
[Thinking Fast and Slow](https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555/ref=as_li_ss_tl?dchild=1&keywords=Thinking+Fast+and+Slow&qid=1598697219&s=books&sr=1-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=paperbacktrav-20&linkId=f4e600cf5a91febfee488e4e95cd7e0d&language=en_US).

System One represents the unconscious part of the brain which makes decisions
quickly and intuitively.

System Two represents conscious and deliberate thought. Both are important but
System Two needs to be engaged when forecasting. However, System Two requires
more effort and the brain has a cunning habit of performing a “bait-and-switch”,
swapping a hard question for an easier one.

Tetlock uses the example of an experiment in which his colleague asked one group
of ‘regular’ forecasters “How likely is it that the Assad regime will fall in
the next three months?” and another group “ How likely is it that the Assad
regime will fall in the next six months?”

As Tetlock explains: “Unconsciously, they would do a bait and switch, ducking
the hard question that requires calibrating the probability to the time frame
and tackling the easier question about the relative weight of the arguments for
and against the regime’s downfall.”

**They take a base value using an outside view and then adjust with the inside
view**

This means using external information as a starting point, such as considering
how long it will take to complete a project based on the time taken to finish
similar projects in the past, rather than calculating based on how long you
think it will take to complete each individual task.

Only once the superforecaster has used the outside view to find a rough anchor
value will they dive into the inside view to adjust their prediction upwards or
downwards.

**They systematically unpack questions into smaller components**

Tetlock refers to this as “Fermi-izing” which is named after the Italian
engineer Enrico Fermi. He developed a method of estimating that is often
described as a ‘back-of-the-envelope’ calculation that can get surprisingly
close to the real answer.

Fermi-izing is designed for the types of questions that cannot be solved by
common mathematical or scientific information. Tetlock uses an example: “How
many piano tuners are there in Chicago?” At first it seems ridiculous, but
Tetlock walks through how this can be broken down into smaller questions.

To know how many piano tuners there are in Chicago, we need to have an idea of
how many pianos. To get to a rough estimate of that number we can take the
population of Chicago and then consider what percentage of the population owns a
piano.

From there, how often does a piano likely need tuning and how long does it take?
For a detailed breakdown of this example,
[read this](https://www.wired.com/2014/08/how-to-solve-crazy-open-ended-google-interview-questions/#:~:text=8.,58%20piano%20tuners%20in%20Chicago)
(this type of puzzle is often used in interviews for roles at tech companies).

Superforecasters think this way, enabling them to reach a comprehensive
understanding of what they know and what they do not know.

## How this book can help you

There’s much more that I haven’t even attempted to go into in the section above,
such as the use of
[Brier Scores](https://www.wired.com/2014/08/how-to-solve-crazy-open-ended-google-interview-questions/#:~:text=8.,58%20piano%20tuners%20in%20Chicago)
to measure performance and Tetlock’s discoveries that combining the forecasts of
superforecasters led to even better prediction accuracy.

At its core, Superforecasting will lead you to perform an audit of your own
decision making skills. Decisions are based on predictions about the future so
the better you are at framing predictions more specifically and then forecasting
accurately, the better your decisions will be.
