## Summary of main ideas

The main concept that I took away from reading this book was that through
certain practises and adopting certain ways of thinking we can, over some time,
create a future self of us that is beyond all current expectations.

As humans, due to the way we are wired we very easily fall into certain habits.
These habits can be quite detrimental to our health and overall well-being.
Couple that with everyday stresses and trials and tribulations that life throws
at you, you can quite easily become ill or defeated or just stuck in a rut.

However by adopting certain **meditation techniques**, concentrating on **energy
centres** within the body and releasing trapped energies, feeling the emotion of
your future self and doing all these things repetitively and consistently can
lead to amazing ‘supernatural’ results. I particularly liked his in-depth
explanation about the
[**pineal gland**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0VPDd0JwCE) and how you can
do certain exercises and meditations to stimulate it into action. The apparent
result can range from anything from visions to out of body experiences to
fractal patterns to some kind of life-changing mystical experience. He also
explained about becoming more wave and less particle. He incorporated
explanations from Quantum physics and talked about the unified field of
everything. The explanations about the earth’s magnetic field and how it affects
us and other phenomenon such as solar flares was also super interesting.

I have to say the main reason for my reading this book was when watching his
interview his enthusiasm for what he was explaining really shined through. For
someone to become that excited about what he was doing I thought there had to be
something in it. I admit I got a little lost when he was talking about the
quantum unified field and how we use that to create our future selves and
feeling that emotion can have some effect on our genes switching certain ones on
and others off. The theory made sense but it can be a little tricky to follow.

Overall I really liked the book. It had quite a few practical examples in it and
also explained the more science aspects in pretty simple language. There were
elements or ideas that Joe repeated throughout the book which towards the end
became a little tedious but I genuinely think he was just trying to really
impress his core ideas.

## How this book can help you

I would urge anyone that reads this book to go into it with an open mind. I
think if nothing else this book can help you understand that there are many
energies and forces in play around us everyday and if we aren't aware of them we
can end up in physically and mentally difficult positions. Energies can get
trapped in certain energy centres and this leads to certain negative behaviours
manifesting.

This book also provides real practical advise and practises that you can (with a
bit of self discipline) implement into your day to day life and will have real
lasting impact. There are plenty of pictures and diagrams giving further visual
explanations to certain concepts. I imagine different people will be drawn to
different parts of this book but Joe does a very good job of giving context and
background on why things are the way they are and what you can do about it.

## Some good further reading/watching/listening

This is a nice interview on London Real which gives you a taste of Joe's energy
and enthusiam for what he does:
