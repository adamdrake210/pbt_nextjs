## In a nutshell description

In this book Rupert outlines seven different spiritual practices that are shown
to bring many benefits to the individual practicing them. For each practice he
dives into great detail offering insight into the origins of these practices and
then scientific research which confirms the benefits derived from them.

Rupert explains this list of seven is merely a selection of practices and by no
means is this list exhaustive. The seven practices are:

1. **Meditation**
2. **Gratitude**
3. **Connecting with Nature**
4. **Relating to Plants**
5. **Rituals**
6. **Singing and Chanting**
7. **Pilgrimages and Holy Places**

Rupert practices all of these seven and provides great insight into each
practice. For example he tells a story of how he gave his godson a birthday
present once which was an experience and not a material gift. The experience was
to walk the last ten miles of a traditional pilgrimage to Canterbury and then
walk around the cathedral clockwise before going in. They lit candles and said
prayers and then had cream tea and sang in the choral evensong. Since then they
have repeated the pilgrimage every year.

## Why I love this book

There are a couple of reasons why I really liked this book. Firstly, all of
these seven practices are pretty accessible and Rupert even gives good
suggestions at the end of each chapter.

One particular practice that stood out for me was connecting with nature and
more specifically finding a ‘sitting place’ in nature. This is somewhere in
nature where you can go and just sit and be. He advises to sit there at least
once a week throughout the year and to just be present. To become aware of the
constant change, become aware of the noises, the animals and trees. He then goes
on to explain the scientific studies that show the enormous benefits of spending
time in nature such as elevated mood levels, less anxiousness and less worry.
This example is just one of many very simple examples.

This is the basic premise of this book. By incorporating simple spiritual
practices into your life you can greatly enhance the richness of it and there is
science to back this all up.

## Quotes to make you think

“I cannot pretend that I am without fear. But my predominant feeling is one of
gratitude. I have loved and been loved. I have been given much and I have given
something in return . . . Above all, I have been a sentient being on this
beautiful planet, and that in itself has been an enormous privilege and
adventure.” ― Rupert Sheldrake

## Read this book if…

If you are tired of the relentless pursuit for more and more in your life and
you have tried to be more and more ‘productive’ then this book could well be for
you. This book is more about nourishing one’s soul and this is something that is
greatly needed in our society at the moment.

If you are feeling some sort of disconnect or lack of something in your life
then these seven practices could well help you fulfill some of this lack. The
beauty of these practices too is that you can start very small. If you live near
a forest you can simply go for a short walk through there. If you live near a
church you can go and sit in on an evensong. If you live in a city then you can
visit a park and just sit next to a tree for a while and just be present with
the tree.

Also if you think these things are a bit too ‘out there’ you can just
concentrate on the science. The research is there that shows these things are
surprisingly good for the human condition and it’s no coincidence that these
things have been practiced throughout our ancestry.

## What others say about it

"I have personally adopted many of the practices Rupert Sheldrake describes in
his book and experienced more love, joy, empathy, gratitude, and equanimity as a
result." ― **Deepak Chopra, MD**
