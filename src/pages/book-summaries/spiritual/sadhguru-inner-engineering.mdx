intro:
  'Sadhguru states that Guru means “dispeller of darkness, someone who opens the
  door for you. . . . As a guru, I have no doctrine to teach, no philosophy to
  impart, no belief to propagate. And that is because the only solution for all
  the ills that plague humanity is self-transformation. Self-transformation
  means that nothing of the old remains. It is a dimensional shift in the way
  you perceive and experience life.”'

## In a nutshell description

In his book ‘Inner Engineering’ Sadhguru speaks about his own life and his own
awakening on a mountaintop in South India. He then goes on to explain about the
system of Yoga (not just the physical aspect you see in most gyms these days)
and how turning inwards shines a light on the path of spiritual growth.

He also introduces the reader to the different dimensions of life beyond the
physical and mental. How there are different kinds of intelligences and
different kinds of energies within our body and all around us. He introduces us
to powerful tools and practises that the reader can utilise to help themselves
along their own spiritual paths.

Sadhguru would like everyone to live a life of joy and this book is one way he
is helping humanity achieve that.

> ‘Yoga is not about being superhuman; it is about realizing that being human is
> super” - Sadhguru

## Quotes to make you think

“The sign of intelligence is that you are constantly wondering. Idiots are
always dead sure about every damn thing they are doing in their life.” ―
**Sadhguru**

‘Yoga is not about being superhuman; it is about realizing that being human is
super” - **Sadhguru**

## Why I love this book

I first discovered Sadhguru on Youtube and many concepts he explained really
made sense to me. He has a way of looking and explaining about certain aspects
of life that is very refreshing for me.

This book is a guide for looking at certain aspects of your life as well as
providing some practical activities you can do. He explains about certain
dimensions of life that are seldom talked about in the Western world and it
really connected with me. Through reading this book I realised there were
certain dimensions to this existence that you generally don’t notice until you
start to pay attention. Very subtle things within your body that once you start
to pay attention you begin to notice and you realise the complexity of the human
system.

Sadhguru is a very good teacher on a very tricky subject and I really like his
explanations and stories more than anything. This book is also something you can
keep coming back to. You can open at any page and read some passage and so far I
have always gained something from it.

## Read this book if…

You would like to start turning inwards and learn more about the nature of
yourself. Sadhguru has a way of explaining very abstract topics that brings
clarity and a new perspective on how you look at the world. He also offers
practical steps you can take that can help you on your spiritual path.

## What others day about it

“Inner Engineering is a fascinating read of Sadhguru’s insights and his
teachings. If you are ready, it is a tool to help awaken your own inner
intelligence, the ultimate and supreme genius that mirrors the wisdom of the
cosmos.” — **Deepak Chopra**

“Contrarian and consistent, ancient and contemporary, Inner Engineering is a
loving invitation to live our best lives and a profound reassurance of why and
how we can.” — **Sir Ken Robinson,**
