## Summary of main ideas

Lost and Founder is a jarringly candid account of building and running a quite
successful startup. Rand Fishkin co-founded [Moz](https://moz.com/) with his
mother in 2001 as a Search Engine Optimization (SEO) consultancy before moving
into creating SEO products.

At the time of publishing the book, he was already a well-known figure in the
world of marketing, having based the Moz business model on producing a steady
stream of practical content to teach marketers about SEO, many of whom would go
on to pay for the company’s suite of SEO tools. For a while Moz was the
preeminent software company in the SEO space.

With Lost and Founder, Fishkin turns the spotlight on himself and his
experiences as a founder, from the exhilaration of seeing his company grow and
provide value to its customers, to the crushing lows of having to let people go
following bad business decisions, navigating the harsh world of venture capital
and dealing with depression.

It is an exceptional book, mainly for the absolute transparency and humility
with which Fishkin describes his experiences. He uses these as a backdrop for
giving specific advice that may not always fit with the conventional wisdom of
the startup world (his nuanced explanations of why the Minimum Viable Product
approach can damage a business is a good example).

And, he makes a point of explaining the nuts and bolts of how things work, such
as explaining how the interests of venture capitalists are likely to be very
different to those of a startup founder. A particularly interesting section
dealt with Fishkin’s decision to turn down an acquisition offer from Hubspot
that would have made him a multi-millionaire. He explains that, at the time, he
felt the valuation was too low and assumed the opportunity would arise again.
Ultimately it did not.

Lost and Founder is certainly not a warning against founding a business. If
anything it’s a love letter to entrepreneurship, from someone who has been in
love, had their heart broken and allowed themselves to fall in love again.

## How this book can help you

Lost and Founder should be essential reading to anyone who either runs their own
business or plans to, but it is also a valuable read to anyone working at a
startup in any capacity because it provides a clear roadmap to building good
practices in areas such as recruitment, building a company culture and
approaching product development decisions.

Aside from the strategic and tactical perspective, it’s an enjoyable read
whoever you are. Fishkin is such an engaging character who has written this book
as a human first and business leader second.
