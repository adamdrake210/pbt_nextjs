  We are delighted to welcome Jose Barros as our new interviewee. Jose is a
  family man, with a regular job as a middle-manager in a global company. He
  likes books, spending time with his kids, cooking and travelling to new
  locations. But that's just on the surface. In his inner self, Jose is a
  revolutionary, an agitator, a free mind, a complex bundle of beliefs and
  values.

  <h2>The Gulag Archipelago - Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn</h2>

By far the most powerful, epic, brutal and revealing work I have read to this
day. As a literary work and historical document absolutely insurmountable.

Solzhenitsyn takes us on an unforgettable trip to the core of the Soviet terror
and it's punishment system: a network of forced labour camps known as GULAG.
Relentlessly, the author reveals the nuts and bolts of a regime that was
dehumanized and ruthless, in it's path to engineer a new classless society. The
arrests, the torture, the trials, the unbearable life in the camps.

There is no logic, no common sense, no reasoning. The system devours human lifes
and reduces their importance to mere numbers. Disposable numbers. Nonetheless,
the biggest achievement of the book is to show the resilience of the human
spirit under the most harsh circumstances. They can punish the body as much as
they like, but they cannot punish and incarcerate the spirit.

This is a book about the boundaries of human nature and the resistance of the
soul. It's not a read. It's a challenge.

  <h2>Secondhand Time: The Last of the Soviets - Svetlana Alexievich</h2>

  altText="Secondhand Time: The Last of the Soviets - Svetlana Alexievich"
  imageCategory="book-summaries"
/>

It's a "tough" book to read, full of disenchantment and frustration. An ideal
complement to "The Gulag Archipelago" by Solzhenitsyn The Archipelago reports
exhaustively on the construction of the "Soviet man". Alexievich's work tells of
its end and how people are still dealing with their disappointment.

The book is not a nostalgic compendium of interviews, but a crude, realistic
account of time and life after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The Soviet
project was much more than a political regime. It was literally a gigantic
social engineering venture. The "Soviet man" survives the end of the regime and
tries to adapt to a new world. There are no complex theories or deep thoughts on
how that transformation is happening. People speak, the "common people”, filling
the pages with their soul and feelings.

The book is painful, I would not consider it an object of entertainment. It is a
dip in a whirlwind of thoughts, emotions, soul spills. It tires us, draws energy
from the reader, envelops us in a scenario without a light at the end of the
tunnel. It is a book of modern times but about a reality that most of us cannot
even start to imagine.

Is the book worth the "sacrifice"? Of course, only the masterpieces are able to
move the individual so much. In fact, this is an unmissable piece of literature.

  <h2>The long walk to freedom - Nelson Mandela</h2>
</Box>

<Image266x400

  altText="The long walk to freedom - Nelson Mandela"
  imageCategory="book-summaries"

A remarkable autobiography of a remarkable man.

There are questions raised about the fact that a historical character with the
dimension of Mandela followed, at a certain point in his life, a path of armed
struggle. For purists, this is unacceptable, especially for a Nobel Peace Prize
winner. However, given the political and social context of South Africa at that
time, by reading the book, you realize that this option was not only
understandable but also an inevitable consequence of the fight against the
apartheid regime.

Mandela conveys his personality in the way he writes: a practical man, of an
unusual intelligence, with a disarming simplicity and a set of absolutely
unshakable convictions. The vast majority of ordinary mortals would have given
up along the path of this long walk to freedom. Mandela resisted and prevailed,
therefore winning a place in the gallery of the righteous icons of Humanity. By
doing so he also created the greatest tragedy of his life: his political
struggle had a happy outcome but his personal life never brought him the joy he
hoped for. The great price that Mandela paid for his political ideals was the
loss of strong family bonds and that sorrow accompanied him until the end of his
days.

A book to learn that, even the greatest figures of Human History, suffer from
the common problems and tribulations that all of us face in daily life.

  <h2>The Trial - Franz Kafka</h2>
</Box>

<Image266x400

  altText="The Trial - Franz Kafka"
  imageCategory="book-summaries"
/>

Kafka leaves no one indifferent: you either love it or hate it.

The Process is an unfinished book. Unfinished by the author and unfinished in
the interpretation that each of the readers can make of the story. Is it an
allegory? Is it ultra-realism? Could it be that the main character (Joseph K) is
all of us?

I understand those that may not have patience for this book. That doesn't make
someone less intelligent or less cultured. The digestion of this “process” is
not easy: the narrative is dense, sometimes disconnected, the characters
stereotyped. The book seems to want to go everywhere and nowhere at the same
time. But Kafka makes us think, awakens minds, rejects indifference (even if in
the end you only want to insult the author for “wasting your time”.). Those are
precisely the merits of this “novel”: it questions and makes us question.

Kafka is a subversive read. I dare you to try it.

<AmazonCta link="" />

The common undertone of all these tremendous books is one of the less valued
qualities inherent to human nature: resilience. It's present in the overwhelming
pressure of a brutal social engineering exercise, exposed in "The Gulag
Archipelago". It's featured in "Secondhand Time: The Last of the Soviets" by the
agonizing voices of those that lived through a broken promise of a better
future. It's described perfectly in "The long road to freedom", that glorifies
the power of the mind over body. And finally, resilience is one of the many
interpretations that can be found in "The process": the ability to survive our
self-created monsters.

That's what those books gave me: they made me more resilient. More capable of
dealing with change, adapt to it, embrace it and learn from it. The notion that
there are no limits to what the human spirit can endure and the strong believe
that, like a flower that is capable of growing in the unospitable stone of a
cliff, humans can and will thrive as a race, regardless of what the future holds
for us.

## About Jose

Jose Barros is a family man, with a regular job as a middle-manager in a global
company. He likes books, spending time with his kids, cooking and travelling to
new locations. But that's just on the surface. In his inner self, Jose is a
revolutionary, an agitator, a free mind, a complex bundle of beliefs and values.
He likes to agitate the waters, to bring disruption where consensus is the norm.
He hates people because he spends too much time analyzing their behaviors and
their social interactions. He thinks he knows too much about them, so it's
better to distance himself. But he is a good guy. He really is.
