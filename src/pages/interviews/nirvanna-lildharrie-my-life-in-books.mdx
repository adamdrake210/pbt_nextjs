When I attended college in the early 2010’s, I had a very misconstrued view on
feminism. Like many, I was also under the impression that feminists were people
who hated men and burned bras. Then through my Sociology major, I took classes
about race, the media, and, of course, gender. I learned that the distribution
of power in a society is completely arbitrary. And once I saw the inequality, I
could not unsee it.

While all this was happening, my seven female cousins on my dad’s side were all
working to empower each other. We started a book club and the first book we
wanted to read was “Lean In.” Lean In helped reinforce what I was beginning to
understand about women in society. It spoke about how the higher you climb in
the corporate ladder, the fewer the women there are. She highlighted the
systematic structures that prevent women from gaining positions of power.

People who have not read the book will criticize it as anti-housewife, which is
not the case. Sandberg invites women who’d prefer it to lean in at work to do so
guilt-free, and for men to lean in at home. This balances gender in the private
and public spheres. Doing so would allow for the world to have better access to
the best talent, rather than the best male talent alone.

I read this book during my senior year of college, right before entering the
workforce. Throughout my career thus far, Sandberg’s words have encouraged me to
“have a seat at the table” at meetings. She popularized the term “imposter
syndrome." Being able to identify those feelings of self-doubt have made them
easier to overcome.

I’ve also seen the world change since this book came out.

In college, a meme of my face went viral with the caption “Gender is a social
construct.” The joke was that Tufts kids said complicated academic stuff that no
one understood. Since graduating, I've heard the phrase used more and more. I’ve
also seen feminism become more mainstream in the media. Movies, shows, and books
now have complex female characters. Lingerie companies make their products for
women’s comfort and confidence first. The #MeToo movement publicizes sexual
abuse and harassment committed by men.

I’m happy to say I tried to reread “Lean In” recently and it felt outdated.
While there’s still much progress to make, the world entered a new era for women
right around the time that I became one.

People think this book is about giving away all your belongings. I love this
book because it taught me about what I should keep.

In the KonMari method, you take out all your things within a single category
like clothing or books. Then you hold each item one-by-one and notice the
instant implicit response the item gives you. What she tells you to look for is
what “sparks joy.” She compares this feeling to what you may feel when you see a
puppy (love, perhaps?).

I’ve heard some people say that they don’t feel attachment to things. i.e. When
they pick up a pair of pants, their gut doesn’t guide them in any specific
direction. To those people, I’d say: Listen closer. It’s not about the thing
itself; this method is all about you. It’s about recognizing how you feel about
something. It’s about asking yourself what you want and realizing that you
already have all the answers you’re looking for.

This book helped me take cognizance of what I want. It helped me slow down
before I buy something new. I now put more consideration into what I want to
bring into my home. This has helped me transform my home into a real haven that
warms me with gratitude every single day. The positive energy of my home is what
keeps me going on the hardest of days.

The other major concept it taught me was how to let things go.

When you’re using the KonMari method, if an object no longer sparks joy, it can
still be difficult to part with it. Kondo’s advice is to thank the object before
discarding or donating it. I can’t tell you how many times I now say thank you
before I throw something out. Once you get the hang of it, this method
translates well beyond physical objects. You can assess opportunities, grudges,
relationships and other intangible things that burden us.

The TV show they made is definitely fun, but I urge you to read the book. You
could read the whole thing in a day, but you’ll likely want to savor it for
longer.

Before I turned 27 last year, I had this crippling anxiety about who I am and
what I’m supposed to be doing with my life. As a classic over-sharer, I brought
it up on a casual intro lunch with a colleague when he asked, “How are you?

And he (emphasis on the “he”) then asked me if I ever read Eat, Pray, Love. I
wasn’t sure if he was serious because, well, “Eat Pray Love” is often a
punchline. I never in a million years thought that I would ever read that book.
Now, I was speaking to this straight, white male colleague who was quite serious
when he said it was a great book. Impressed, I asked, “You read books written by
women?”

Desperate for resolve, I ordered it right away and pored over every word. It
feels good to read this book. Gilbert writes exquisite prose. While it’s a
memoir, there’s magical realism on every page. I found the book to be
delightful, comforting, and even indulgent.

She was someone who did everything in life by the book and then scrapped it all
because she wasn’t happy. Gilbert was someone who had structure, control, and
rigorous plans. But she desired momentous change. I reveled at her bravery as
she took control of her life and left to enjoy her own company for a bit.

This book created a space to get in touch with my spiritual side and gave me
permission to enjoy life on my own terms. Its beauty brought me plenty of
moments of quiet and internal peace. It taught me it's okay to let go of control
and trust my own intuition.

Best of all, I ordered the 10 year anniversary book, which was a happy accident
because it included a forward by Elizabeth Gilbert 10 years later speaking to
the virality of the book and its global impact. Pro tip: If you get the 10 Year
Anniversary version, read the forward at the end. And, whatever you do, don’t
watch the movie (it’s trash).
