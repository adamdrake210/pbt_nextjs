There are a number of great misconceptions about mathematics. One is
that it is accurate, neat and tidy. Infact only the final proofs and
techniques, refined over many years or centuries are concinse, neat,
logical steps.

In school you are generaly given a set of problems to solve and a set
of procedures to solve them. Not much is said about the meta-procedure
of applying specific techniques. I have taken many courses in
mathematics and now read text books as a hoby, but it was only when I
read "How to solve it" was I explicitly introduced to the heuristics
of mathematical problem solving.

Unlike famous mathematical proofs themselves, the process of creating
a proof is messy, unstructured and an often random search for a
solution. I wondered for a long time if I simply was missing something
or just had the wrong type of brain for maths, but Polya's book helped
me to understand, that no, it really is a fucking mess.

It is also a practically useful book, even if you are not interested
in mathematics. If you study enough problems you will figure out the
techniques for yourself, but it's a potentially very large shortcut
and demystifies mathematics.

This is the most sacred book of the programmers. When I was beginning
my studies in hackery, I read an article, similar to this one where
all the prophets of computing were asked "what are your favorite
books?". Almost all answered "1. GEB!". I now proudly continue that
tradition.

Like any true masterpiece this book defies any attempt at creating a
summary. It is irreducible; only a lossy compression is possible. It
both educates you on the power of symbolic computation, in a way
accessible to the uninitiated and at the same time shows its
boundaries. There is a lot of abstract stuff in this book, but thanks
to the mighty computer it also contains practical knowledge.

I have bought at least two copies of this book.

  <h2>The Incerto Series - Nassim Taleb</h2>

  altText="The Incerto Series - Nassim Taleb"
  imageCategory="book-summaries"
/>

This is cheating because it is actually a series of books, but Nassim
meanders about and the chapters of one book could be transplanted to
another. Like GEB, these books defy compression and it is Taleb
himself who points out that it is a bad sign if a book can be
summarised.

In recent years both Taleb's books and his [book recommendations](https://fs.blog/2012/02/book-recommendations-from-nassim-taleb/) have drastically
altered my thinking. He ties together many domains under a framework
of probabilistic reasoning and time tested philosophy.

It's joked that Taleb's acolytes become experts on everything. There
is fair criticism in this joke, but also I think many miss the
point. Taleb only claims expertise in probability, yet provides
insights into many areas, by providing tools for dealing with
uncertainty.

You can not know everything about everything, in fact I don't even
know everything about software I have created. The set of possible
behaviors my code is capable of, vastly exceeds what I can compute in
my head or even formally verify. Taleb can tell you the same thing
despite not being an expert in my area*. He points out that people
often suffer from domain blindness and despite being aware of
phenomena leading to dangerous randomness in one domain, can not see
it in another. This is despite the fact the same mathematics and other
forms of reasoning apply to both.

In one book he quips that adding randomness (or stochasticity) to a
process often improves the result. Indeed I used some stochasticity in
[a library I created for reproducing bugs in the Linux kernel](https://richiejp.com/a-rare-data-race). 
This was much simpler than other possible solutions and more robust. 
He gives examples in completely different domains.

It takes a great deal of expertise to create a rocket ship, but only
common sense to decide whether you should take a ride on one. Note
that the less you know about rockets the simpler answering this
question becomes. Let's say you at least know the history of this
ship's safety, so you know there is some chance you might die. Then
it's a question of what you will get for riding on it.

However the type of randomness described above is not what Taleb is
most concerned about, although it is important when deciding whether
to go skiing off piste or smuggling cocaine. The most dangerous type
of randomness is modeled by fat-tailed probability distributions. It
is characterised by exponential growth and/or violent non-linear
changes which vastly exceed what was previously seen.

Taleb goes off on many tangents, but it usually comes back to how to
act, both morally and successfully. It's easy to misinterpret what he
is saying as he switches mental models depending on the phenomena
being dealt with. He's not a simpleton with an absolutist view of the
world and also a bit of a character who sees it as his moral duty to
attack dangerous bullshitters. This puts him at the center of a lot of
controversy and creates noise around his work.

I have bought the Incerto series twice (another of Taleb's favourite aphorisms
is never to read a book you wouldn't read twice) and many of the books
by authors he takes his inspiration from. So far it has been the gift
which keeps giving.

Over the years I have come to believe that all human beings have
roughly the same "natural intelligence", whatever that means. This
comes from my own experience of learning, mathematics, computer
science and languages as an adult, when as a child I was, for the most
part, a certified idiot. Definitely there are people with
disabilities, however I believe everyone else hovers around an
average.

That is to say I think the raw computing power of human brains are
normally distributed. To use a phrase from The Incerto, they exist in
Mediocristan rather than Extremistan. You may get people who, for
example, are able to store 1.1x to 1.5x of the average in short term
memory. However you will not get someone with the innate ability to
store 100x or a 1000x the average.

However we do see in the world that there are people who are 100x
better at even simple tasks such as memorising numbers. Anders does a
beautiful job of explaining how this can happen. Some of the book is
merely hypotheses, but he also gives a concrete example of how people
have achieved 10-100x performance. Essentially while short term memory
can only store so many symbols and genetics, exercise, diet etc. may
only increase this incrementally, there are tricks which allow one to
achieve many multiples the performance.

Anders also speculates that the abilities of high performers who are
identified as natural geniuses, can in fact be explained by
environmental factors. For me, in my daily life, it doesn't matter too
much how true this is. What matters is that whatever effect genetics
has on intelligence it is less important than factors which we can
control. This is an empowering and useful belief, or perhaps it would
be better to say it is a useful assumption which leads to better
courses of action.

On the other hand, and somewhat ironically given the front cover of the
book, I think elite sports are limited completely by physical strength
and therefor genetics. It's only where pure thought is concerned that
you can achieve multiple times the performance.

  <h2>Dune - Frank Herbert</h2>

<Image266x400

  imageCategory="book-summaries"

Dune, of course, is a work of fiction and therefor is expressed in a way
that allows for more meaning to be imposed upon it than a work of
non-fiction expressing the same concepts. With that in mind, every
time I read Dune, I find more profound philosophical,
socio-political-theological-economic-ecological commentary for which
the narrative of Dune is merely a backdrop, an allegory. Perhaps it
would be better to call it religious fiction because it is perhaps
religion for secular nerds.

Out of the books listed here, I probably read this at the youngest age
and so it may be the most formative despite being fiction. It
introduced the idea that in order for some things to get stronger,
they must endure hardship strong enough to remove the weaker
components, but not so strong it destroys or cripples the whole. This
should not be an unfamiliar concept given natural selection is taught
in school, however people are still surprised by it and fail to see
all the places it applies. It can be seen in hormesis and antifragile
processes (a term coined by Taleb).

I don't know how much I really learnt from Dune and how much I am
layering on top of it with more recent knowledge. Ultimately though I
think it tipped me towards seeking out harder paths that in the long
run have made my life better.

Unfortunately a new film is being made and while it does look like a
good film; the themes of Dune are not things which can be expressed in
film. The film will be a collection of attractive people riding CGI
sand worms occasionally uttering simplified dialog designed to reach
the widest audience possible. I will probably enjoy the film, because
I like special effects, but will then have to endure people discussing
"Dune", after only watching the film.

People often like to wave 1984 around in the air at every available
opportunity while calling their opponents fascists or leftists. Which
is good (except that 1984, Animal farm etc. suffer from the same issue
as Dune), but in the other hand they should have a copy of The True
Believer. It's a travesty that this book isn't slapped in people's
faces every time mass movements begin their descent into radical
nonsense.

Eric points out that Stalin and Hitler did not worry so much about
their followers defecting to the Allies, but instead to each
other. For a number of reasons, but largely because extreme ideologies
offer mostly the same things to the extremist. Your moderate
progressive is less likely to switch to conservative, than a hardline
leftist to a fascist.

The reason being the moderates have genuine differences in beliefs
whereas the extremists both just want the same thing: to burn it the
fuck down in an orgasmic flurry of violence and end their own painful
existence in the process. Whether they are fighting for God, against
religion, in some race war or against racism doesn't matter so long as
their is the opportunity for pandemonium.

What amuses me about this book is how I found it; it is mentioned by
[Theodore Kaczynski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Kaczynski) in his manifesto which he committed acts of
terrorism in order to achieve circulation. If you have ever wondered
"What would happen if a highly technical and erudite person, who
completely rejected society and had zero fear of repercussions
developed an idealogy", then check out [Industrial Society and Its
Future](https://www.amazon.com/Unabomber-Manifesto-Industrial-Society-Future/dp/1595948155/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=paperbacktrav-20&linkId=10de9ee683167f382dc598a2dafd2a84&language=en_US) (needless to say the content requires some emotional
detachment). Unfortunately for Theodore's movement, there is nothing
man-made more powerful than technologie, it co-opted religion and now
there is nothing left to stand in its way. I'll leave it as an open
question as to whether Theodore himself is a True Believer.
