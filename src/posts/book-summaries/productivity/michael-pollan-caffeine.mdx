## In a nutshell description

In this little book about Caffeine (only available on Audible currently) Michael
Pollan looks into one of the most widely used psychoactive stimulants in today’s
society. Michael gives the history of this seemingly innocent plant and how it
made it’s way over to the western world and the surprisingly major impact it had
on the shaping of western society and continues to have today. What’s more, the
author shows that the Industrial Revolution would have been impossible without
it.

Through the course of writing this book Michael actually gives up any form of
caffeine for a period of 3 months because he was advised that this was the only
way he would truly understand his relationship with the drug. He then vividly
describes the day’s event when he is allowed once more to administer some
caffeine once again - in the form of a flat white from one of his favorite
coffee haunts - the euphoria he felt and then how this almost immediately
impacted his behaviour and resulting day.

## Why I love this book

I am a big fan of coffee and I am always surprised by the lack of wonder around
this drug. I literally feel euphoric at times when I consume it and I am deeply
intrigued by the effect consumption of caffeine has on my life.

To find out caffeine’s impact on Western society and how deep a role it seemed
to have played in the current makeup of our society was really eye opening. I
knew it was addictive but to see the extent to which it determines so much of
people’s behaviour is truly fascinating.

## Quote to make you think

_“​​Caffeine constitutes the largest and longest unsupervised drug experiment
ever conducted on humans"_

## Read this book if…

You consume caffeine in any form then I think you should understand the history
and the facts behind it. I still believe caffeine can very much be part of a
healthy lifestyle but I also think its power over us should not be
underestimated. I also believe the more you understand something the more you
can be aware of its potential impact over you.

Be careful though, you may think twice about your next cup of coffee or even go
as far as to give us caffeine for good!
